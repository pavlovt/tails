# Tails - SailsJS + TypeScript

This is SailsJS project in which you can write your Models and Controllers in TypeScript and your styles in Sass.

## Installation

1. git clone this project
2. npm install

## Usage

1. Open two consoles and go in the project's directory.
2. In one of the consoles start: grunt - it will watch for changes in your ts, sass and other files and will compile them.
3. In the other console start: sails lift - it will start the SailsJS server and will reload it on file changes.
4. Go to http://localhost:1337/test/test to see the result

There are example controller and model in ts_api directory - the idea is to writhe there your files and they will be compiled to js and copied in api directory.
